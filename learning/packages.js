// Two type of packages that we can install
// 1 - simple(regular) dependencies
// 2 - development dependencies

 
// Slugify
// npm install slugify
//    which is the small tool that we can use  to make more readable URL's out of names.


// NODEMON
// for dev dependencies -> npm install nodemon --save-dev
//  Nice tool that help us develop node.js applications by automatically restarting.
//  whenever we change some files in our working directory.
//  We want to run this regardless of this project -> sudo npm i nodemon --global 


// in package.json we added "start" to "script"
//  Now we can run this by using -> "npm run start" or "npm start"
